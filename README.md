# A chatbot (originally a chatterbot) is a software application or web interface that aims to mimic human conversation through text or voice interactions.
# a chatbot can be of two types
# 1. Rule-based chatbots 
# 2. AI chatbots

# Rule-based chatbots :
# Rule-based chatbots are like static chatbots that operate on a set of predefined rules and patterns. 
# They follow a deterministic approach to conversation and are typically programmed with specific instructions. 

# Some of the  critical characteristics of the Rule-based chatbots are:
# Static Responses
# Limited Understanding
# Low Complexity

# Examples: Automated customer service chatbots, FAQ bots.

# AI chatbots :
# AI chatbots, also known as machine learning-based chatbots, utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to understand and generate human-like responses.

# Some key characteristics of the AI chatbots are:
# Dynamic Responses
# Natural Language Understanding
# Higher Complexity
# Examples: Siri, Google Assistant, chatbots in customer support that can handle various user inquiries, and virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa.
